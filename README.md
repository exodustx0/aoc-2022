# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I'd initially set out with the plan to use this year's edition to learn Rust, like how I used last year's edition to learn Go, but private-life stress dictated that I instead just focus on doing the challenges _at all_ in order to still have time/energy left once I'm done on a given day.

## Daily notes

### Day 1

4:15 PM â€” Yeah, screw learning Rust, I just want to get through the AoC. Go it is.
