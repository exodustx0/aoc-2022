# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I'd initially set out with the plan to use this year's edition to learn Rust, like how I used last year's edition to learn Go, but private-life stress dictated that I instead just focus on doing the challenges _at all_ in order to still have time/energy left once I'm done on a given day.

## Daily notes

### Day 1

4:15 PM — Yeah, screw learning Rust, I just want to get through the AoC. Go it is.

### Day 3

2:00 PM — Feels inelegant, but it's done and it works. Elegant enough to be understandable, I think.

### Day 5

11:15 AM — Had to rush rush rush cause of other commitments but I did it. I can't help but feel like there's a much more efficient way to do this, but it eludes me and I am momentarily not allowed the time to work that out. Maybe I'll revisit later on in the month and find the improved efficiency.
